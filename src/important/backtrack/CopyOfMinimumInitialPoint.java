/**
 * Minimum Initial Points to Reach Destination
Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points i.e, zero points. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points ( > 0 ). Whenever we pass through
 a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points. We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell 
 (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).
Constraints :
* From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
* We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
* We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.
* Example:â€¨Input: points[m][n] = { {-2, -3,   3}, 
*                         {-5, -10,  1}, 
*                         {10,  30, -5} 
*                       };
* Output: 7
